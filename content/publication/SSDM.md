abstract = "There is growing interest among conservationists in biodiversity mapping based on stacked species distribution models (SSDMs), a method that combines multiple individual species distribution models to produce a community-level model. However, no user-friendly interface specifically designed to provide the basic tools needed to fit such models was available until now. The “ssdm” package is a computer platform implemented in r providing a range of methodological approaches and parameterisation at each step in building the SSDM: e.g. pseudo-absence selection, variable contribution and model accuracy assessment, inter-model consensus forecasting, species assembly design, and calculation of weighted endemism. The object-oriented design of the package is such that: users can modify existing methods, extend the framework by implementing new methods, and share them to be reproduced by others. The package includes a graphical user interface to extend the use of SSDMs to a wide range of conservation scientists and practitioners."
